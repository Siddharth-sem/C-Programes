Logic

1. The program asks the user to enter:

- An operator (+, -, *, /)

- Two integer numbers

2. It uses a switch statement to perform the corresponding arithmetic operation.

3. Division is handled carefully — the program checks for division by zero before performing the operation.

4. The result is displayed with two decimal precision using %.2f.
