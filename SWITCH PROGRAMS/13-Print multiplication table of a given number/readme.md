Logic

1. The program takes an integer input from the user.

2. It initializes i = 1 to start from the first multiple.

3. Using a while loop, it runs as long as i <= 10.

4. Inside the loop, a switch statement checks the value of i.

5. For each case (1 to 10), it prints one line of the multiplication table.

6. The value of i increases after every iteration.

7. The loop ends once all 10 multiples are printed.
