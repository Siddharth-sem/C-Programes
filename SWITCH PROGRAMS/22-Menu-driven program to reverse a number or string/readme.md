Logic

1. Start the program.
2. Display a menu with three choices:
  - Reverse a Number
  - Reverse a String
  - Exit
3. Take the user's choice as input.
4. Use a do-while loop to keep showing the menu until the user chooses Exit.
5. Use if-else and switch inside the loop for different operations:
   - Choice 1: Reverse digits of an integer using modulus and division.
   - Choice 2: Reverse a string using a loop and store in another array.
6. Display the reversed result.
7. End when user selects Exit (3).
