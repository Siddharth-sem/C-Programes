Logic

1. The program takes two integers as input from the user.

2. It first checks whether the two numbers are equal using an if statement.

3. If not equal, the expression (num1 > num2) is evaluated:

- If true → returns 1

- If false → returns 0

4. A switch statement then prints which number is maximum based on this result.
