Logic

1. The program asks the user to enter a number between 1 and 7.

2. Using a switch-case, it prints the corresponding weekday:

- 1 → Monday

- 2 → Tuesday

- 3 → Wednesday

- 4 → Thursday

- 5 → Friday

- 6 → Saturday

- 7 → Sunday

3. If the number is outside the range 1–7, it shows an error message.
