Logic

1. The program asks the user to enter a month number (1–12).

2. It uses a switch-case structure:

- Months with 31 days: 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12

- Months with 30 days: 4, 6, 9, 11

- February (2): 28 or 29 days (depending on leap year)

3. If the input is not between 1 and 12, it displays “Invalid input”.
