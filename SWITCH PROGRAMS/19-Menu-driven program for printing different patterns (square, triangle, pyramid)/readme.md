Logic 

1. Start the program.

2. Declare variables:
- choice (to store user choice)
- rows, i, j (for loops).

3. Display a menu with 3 pattern options:

- 1 → Square Pattern
- 2 → Triangle Pattern
- 3 → Pyramid Pattern

4. Take the user’s choice and number of rows as input.

5. Use a switch-case to decide which pattern to print:

- Case 1: Print Square pattern.
- Case 2: Print Right-angled Triangle pattern.
- Case 3: Print Pyramid pattern.
- Default: Print error message.

7. Use nested for loops to print stars as per the pattern logic.

8. End the program.
