Logic

1. Start the program.

2. Declare variable choice for menu selection.

3. Use a do-while loop to repeatedly show the menu until the user chooses Exit.

4. Use a switch-case statement for each operation:

- Case 1: Calculate factorial of a given number.
- Case 2: Generate Fibonacci series up to n terms.
- Case 3: Check if a number is prime.
- Case 4: Exit the program.
- Default: Display invalid choice message.

5. Use loops for logic:

- for loop for factorial and Fibonacci.
- for loop for prime checking.

6. End the program when user selects Exit.
