Logic 

1. The program takes three integers as input: a, b, and c.

2. It first compares a and b:

- If a >= b, it then compares a and c.
    - If a >= c, then a is the maximum.

    - Otherwise, c is the maximum.

- If b > a, it then compares b and c.

    - If b >= c, then b is the maximum.

    - Otherwise, c is the maximum.

3. Finally, it prints the maximum number.
