Logic

1. Input a number from the user.

2. If the number is 0, it has 1 digit.

3. If negative, make it positive (digits are same for −123 and 123).

4. Divide by 10 repeatedly until number becomes 0 — each division removes one digit.

5. Count how many times division happens.

6. Print the total count.
