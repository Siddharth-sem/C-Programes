Logic

1. Take the student’s marks as input.

2. Check for valid input (marks must be between 0 and 100).

3. Use if–else if statements to assign grades according to the following rules:

- Marks < 50 → Grade F

- 50–59 → Grade D

- 60–69 → Grade C

- 70–79 → Grade B

- 80–89 → Grade A

- 90–100 → Grade A+

4. Display the corresponding grade.
