Logic

1. Input three integer values: age1, age2, and age3.

2. Use if–else conditions to compare:

- If age1 is greater than or equal to both age2 and age3 → Person 1 is oldest.

- Else if age2 is greater than or equal to both → Person 2 is oldest.

- Else → Person 3 is oldest.

3. Display the oldest person and their age.
