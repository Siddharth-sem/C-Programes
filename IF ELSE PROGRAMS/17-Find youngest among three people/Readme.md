Logic

1. Input ages of three people — age1, age2, and age3.

2. Compare the ages using conditional (if-else) statements:

- If one age is smaller than the other two → that person is youngest.

- If two or more ages are equal and smallest → those persons are youngest together.

- If all three are equal → print that all have the same age.
