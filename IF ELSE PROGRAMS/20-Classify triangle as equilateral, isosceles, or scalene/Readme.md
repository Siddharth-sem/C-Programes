Logic

1. Input three integers: s1, s2, and s3 (the sides of a triangle).

2. Check validity using Triangle Inequality Theorem:

- Each side must be greater than 0.

- The sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.

3. If valid, determine type:

- s1 == s2 == s3 → Equilateral

- Any two equal → Isosceles

- All different → Scalene
